A **GPU** is a **Graphics Processing Unit**, a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly accelerate the creation and rendering of images, videos, and animations.

It's essentially a processor optimized for performing complex mathematical calculations simultaneously, which is crucial for tasks involving massive amounts of parallel data processing.

## Key Functions and Architecture

* **Graphics Rendering:** The original and primary function of a GPU is to handle the millions of calculations required to convert 3D data into the 2D images you see on your screen (a process called rendering), enabling smooth, high-quality visuals for gaming, video editing, and content creation.
* **Parallel Processing:** The GPU's strength lies in its **parallel architecture**. Unlike a Central Processing Unit (CPU), which has a few powerful cores optimized for sequential, general-purpose tasks, a GPU has **hundreds or thousands of smaller, more specialized cores**. This design allows the GPU to break down a large problem into many small, identical tasks and execute them all concurrently, providing a massive speedup for highly repetitive computations.
* **Other Applications:** Due to their parallel processing capabilities, GPUs are no longer limited to graphics. They are vital for compute-intensive applications such as:
    * **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** Accelerating the training and deployment of complex models.
    * **Scientific Computing:** Running large-scale simulations and data analysis.
    * **Cryptocurrency Mining:** Solving complex computational problems.

## GPU vs. Graphics Card

The terms are often used interchangeably, but they are technically different:

* **GPU:** The actual specialized processor chip responsible for the computations.
* **Graphics Card (or Video Card):** The entire circuit board assembly that plugs into the computer's motherboard. It contains the **GPU** as its main component, along with dedicated video memory (**VRAM**), ports for display connections, and a cooling system.

GPUs can also be **Integrated (iGPU)**, meaning they are built directly into the computer's CPU and share the system's main memory, common in laptops and basic desktop systems. A **Discrete (dGPU)** GPU, conversely, is a separate, dedicated chip, typically found on a high-performance graphics card.
